## Critical Rules

### Schema changes ripple to the frontend
When modifying schema types, check the frontend's GROQ queries. Field renames or removals are breaking changes.

### Orderable types need `orderRank`
`gallery`, `printCollection`, `lumaPrintSetV2` use `@sanity/orderable-document-list` — new orderable types need `orderRankField`.

### Singleton types need desk structure + action filter
Add new singletons to `SINGLETON_TYPES` in `sanity.config.ts` AND create a desk structure entry.

### Client runtime config stays centralized
All photographer-specific runtime values live in `client.config.ts`. Package
identity and Sanity deployment metadata also change during initial bootstrap.
Schemas, components, actions, and desk structure remain shared and must flow
from this template through focused downstream sync commits.

### Private package installs need npm auth
This template consumes private `@jessepomeroy/*` packages from GitHub Packages.
The repo-level `.npmrc` maps the scope only; never commit a token. Before a
fresh local `pnpm install`, run:

```bash
pnpm config set --location user //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken "$GITHUB_TOKEN"
```

Hosted installs must write the hosted token into npm config before install:

```bash
pnpm config set --location user //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken "$NODE_AUTH_TOKEN" && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev          # Run Studio locally (localhost:3333)
pnpm build        # Build Studio for deployment
pnpm lint         # Run Biome check
pnpm format       # Run Biome format
pnpm sanity deploy   # Deploy Studio to sanity.io
```

## Cloning for a new client

Agent checklist when standing up a new client studio from this template:

1. **Create the new repo** — use GitHub's "Use this template" button, or:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:jessepomeroy/sanity-studio-template.git <client>-studio
   cd <client>-studio
   rm -rf .git && git init
   gh repo create jessepomeroy/<client>-studio --public --source=. --push
   ```
2. **Create the Sanity project** at https://sanity.io/manage. Note the `projectId` and dataset name (usually `production`).
3. **Edit `client.config.ts`** — the only per-client file:
   - `projectId`, `dataset`
   - `studioTitle`, `dashboardHeading`, `dashboardSubtitle`
   - `liveSiteUrl`, `adminDashboardUrl`
   - `enabledSchemas` for optional content modules the client frontend supports
   - `appId` — leave empty for first deploy
4. **Edit `package.json` `name`** to match the new repo.
5. **First deploy** — authenticate GitHub Packages, then run `pnpm install && pnpm sanity deploy`. Sanity prompts for a studio hostname and returns an `appId`; paste it into `client.config.ts` so subsequent deploys are non-interactive.
6. **CORS** — add the spoke site's localhost + prod origins via the Sanity manage UI (or the Sanity MCP `add_cors_origin` tool).
7. **Tokens** — issue per-environment tokens (see "Tokens" below) and store them in the spoke site / CI, not in this repo.

Do NOT modify schemas, desk structure, or custom components in a client studio — those live in the template and need to flow back upstream. If a client needs a divergent schema, that's a signal to lift the change into the template (gated on a `client.config.ts` flag if optional).

---

## Tokens

The studio itself authenticates interactively (`sanity login`) and does not need a token checked in. Tokens are issued per-project at sanity.io/manage → API → Tokens for downstream consumers:

| Token | Role | Used by | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Read | Viewer | Spoke site runtime (`reflecting-pool` etc.) | Reads published content. Skip if dataset is public and only published content is needed. |
| Read+drafts | Viewer + draft access | Spoke site preview / draft mode | Required for Presentation tool's draft-mode toggle. |
| Deploy | Deploy Studio | CI running `sanity deploy` non-interactively | Set as `SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN` in CI secrets. |
| Editor | Editor | MCP scripts, migrations, seed data | Only issue when writes are actually needed. Treat as a privileged credential. |

## Platform Context

This studio is the template for the photographer CRM platform:
- **reflecting-pool** = Maggie's SvelteKit client spoke
- **sanity-studio-template** = Sanity CMS template (this repo)
- **reflecting-pool-studio** = Maggie's instance, cloned from this template
- **@jessepomeroy/admin** = shared admin dashboard package
- **Convex** = operational backend (orders, CRM, messages, notifications)

## Downstream sync

- `../angelsrest-studio` and `../reflecting-pool-studio` are downstream
  instances.
- Shared schema, desk, component, action, or dependency changes land here
  first, then sync downstream as focused commits.
- Downstream-only changes should be limited to `client.config.ts`, package
  identity, deployment metadata, and genuinely client-specific optional-module
  flags.
- Verify the template first, then run the same checks in every affected
  downstream Studio.
- Run `pnpm check:downstream-sync` from the template after syncing. Pass explicit
  downstream paths after `--` when the repositories are not standard siblings.
